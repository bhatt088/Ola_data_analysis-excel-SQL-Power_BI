ðŸš— Ever wondered what rideshare data can teach us about user behavior, cancellations, and payments?

Recently, I wrapped up a deep dive project analyzing Ola ride data, and it was more eye-opening than I expected.



Using MS Excel, SQL, and Power BI, I explored real booking data to answer 10 practical business questions â€” from identifying the most frequent riders and vehicle preferences to uncovering the reasons behind ride cancellations (both from customers and drivers).



ðŸ“Š One of the most interesting takeaways?



 A surprisingly high percentage of driver cancellations were linked to personal and car-related issues â€” something that could directly impact user trust and retention.



On the visualization side, building a clear and intuitive dashboard helped me realize how data storytelling can reveal hidden patterns, especially when working with ride distance trends, customer ratings, and payment method preferences.



This project wasnâ€™t just about crunching numbers and connecting data to real-world decision-making.



By leveraging SQL for data querying, Excel for cleaning, and Power BI for dynamic visualization, I was able to:



1- Uncover key customer behaviors and booking patterns

2- Analyze cancellation reasons from both driver and customer perspectives

3- Identify top-performing customers and vehicle types

4- Evaluate revenue distribution and ratings trends
